# ACSL_Assembly

## Description
This program allows you to execute files containing ACSL assembly language code.

## Information

All information about the language can be found [here](https://www.categories.acsl.org/wiki/index.php?title=Assembly_Language_Programming).

## Add-ons
My program allows comments, which you can put after any line of code.

## How to Run
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your device. Then, run:
```bash
python3 assembly.py file1.txt file2.txt
```
Replace file1.txt, file2.txt, etc., with your own files you want to run.

Example (Assuming all files are in the same folder): ```python3 assembly.py example1.txt```
